abstract = {Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide &amp; Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide &amp; Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.},

abstract = {Feature engineering has been the key to the success of many prediction models. However, the process is nontrivial and often requires manual feature engineering or exhaustive searching. DNNs are able to automatically learn feature interactions; however, they generate all the interactions implicitly, and are not necessarily efficient in learning all types of cross features. In this paper, we propose the Deep &amp; Cross Network (DCN) which keeps the benefits of a DNN model, and beyond that, it introduces a novel cross network that is more efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature interactions. In particular, DCN explicitly applies feature crossing at each layer, requires no manual feature engineering, and adds negligible extra complexity to the DNN model. Our experimental results have demonstrated its superiority over the state-of-art algorithms on the CTR prediction dataset and dense classification dataset, in terms of both model accuracy and memory usage.},

abstract = {The transformer is the most critical algorithm innovation of the Nature Language Processing (NLP) field in recent years. Unlike the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, transformers are able to process on dimensions of sequence lengths in parallel, therefore leads to better accuracy on long sequences. However, efficient deployments of them for online services in data centers equipped with GPUs are not easy. First, more computation introduced by transformer structures makes it more challenging to meet the latency and throughput constraints of serving. Second, NLP tasks take in sentences of variable length. The variability of input dimensions brings a severe problem to efficient memory management and serving optimization.To solve the above challenges, this paper designed a transformer serving system called TurboTransformers, which consists of a computing runtime and a serving framework. Three innovative features make it stand out from other similar works. An efficient parallel algorithm is proposed for GPU-based batch reduction operations, like Softmax and LayerNorm, which are major hot spots besides BLAS routines. A memory allocation algorithm, which better balances the memory footprint and allocation/free efficiency, is designed for variable-length input situations. A serving framework equipped with a new batch scheduler using dynamic programming achieves the optimal throughput on variable-length requests. The system can achieve the state-of-the-art transformer model serving performance on GPU platforms and can be seamlessly integrated into your PyTorch code with a few lines of code.},

abstract = {Unlabeled samples can be intelligently selected for labeling to minimize classification error. In many real-world applications, a large number of unlabeled samples arrive in a streaming manner, making it impossible to maintain all the data in a candidate pool. In this work, we focus on binary classification problems and study selective labeling in data streams where a decision is required on each sample sequentially. We consider the unbiasedness property in the sampling process, and design optimal instrumental distributions to minimize the variance in the stochastic process. Meanwhile, Bayesian linear classifiers with weighted maximum likelihood are optimized online to estimate parameters. In empirical evaluation, we collect a data stream of user-generated comments on a commercial news portal in 30 consecutive days, and carry out offline evaluation to compare various sampling strategies, including unbiased active learning, biased variants, and random sampling. Experimental results verify the usefulness of online active learning, especially in the non-stationary situation with concept drift.},

abstract = {Online advertising allows advertisers to only bid and pay for measurable user responses, such as clicks on ads. As a consequence, click prediction systems are central to most online advertising systems. With over 750 million daily active users and over 1 million active advertisers, predicting clicks on Facebook ads is a challenging machine learning task. In this paper we introduce a model which combines decision trees with logistic regression, outperforming either of these methods on its own by over 3%, an improvement with significant impact to the overall system performance. We then explore how a number of fundamental parameters impact the final prediction performance of our system. Not surprisingly, the most important thing is to have the right features: those capturing historical information about the user or ad dominate other types of features. Once we have the right features and the right model (decisions trees plus logistic regression), other factors play small roles (though even small improvements are important at scale). Picking the optimal handling for data freshness, learning rate schema and data sampling improve the model slightly, though much less than adding a high-value feature, or picking the right model to begin with.},

abstract = {Many machine learning applications operate in dynamic environments that change over time, in which models must be continually updated to capture the recent trend in data. However, most of today's learning frameworks perform training offline, without a system support for continual model updating.In this paper, we design and implement Continuum, a general-purpose platform that streamlines the implementation and deployment of continual model updating across existing learning frameworks. In pursuit of fast data incorporation, we further propose two update policies, cost-aware and best-effort, that judiciously determine when to perform model updating, with and without accounting for the training cost (machine-time), respectively. Theoretical analysis shows that cost-aware policy is 2-competitive. We implement both polices in Continuum, and evaluate their performance through EC2 deployment and trace-driven simulations. The evaluation shows that Continuum results in reduced data incorporation latency, lower training cost, and improved model quality in a number of popular online learning applications that span multiple application domains, programming languages, and frameworks.},
