abstract = {Unlabeled samples can be intelligently selected for labeling to minimize classification error. In many real-world applications, a large number of unlabeled samples arrive in a streaming manner, making it impossible to maintain all the data in a candidate pool. In this work, we focus on binary classification problems and study selective labeling in data streams where a decision is required on each sample sequentially. We consider the unbiasedness property in the sampling process, and design optimal instrumental distributions to minimize the variance in the stochastic process. Meanwhile, Bayesian linear classifiers with weighted maximum likelihood are optimized online to estimate parameters. In empirical evaluation, we collect a data stream of user-generated comments on a commercial news portal in 30 consecutive days, and carry out offline evaluation to compare various sampling strategies, including unbiased active learning, biased variants, and random sampling. Experimental results verify the usefulness of online active learning, especially in the non-stationary situation with concept drift.},

abstract = {Many machine learning applications operate in dynamic environments that change over time, in which models must be continually updated to capture the recent trend in data. However, most of today's learning frameworks perform training offline, without a system support for continual model updating.In this paper, we design and implement Continuum, a general-purpose platform that streamlines the implementation and deployment of continual model updating across existing learning frameworks. In pursuit of fast data incorporation, we further propose two update policies, cost-aware and best-effort, that judiciously determine when to perform model updating, with and without accounting for the training cost (machine-time), respectively. Theoretical analysis shows that cost-aware policy is 2-competitive. We implement both polices in Continuum, and evaluate their performance through EC2 deployment and trace-driven simulations. The evaluation shows that Continuum results in reduced data incorporation latency, lower training cost, and improved model quality in a number of popular online learning applications that span multiple application domains, programming languages, and frameworks.},

abstract = {Online advertising allows advertisers to only bid and pay for measurable user responses, such as clicks on ads. As a consequence, click prediction systems are central to most online advertising systems. With over 750 million daily active users and over 1 million active advertisers, predicting clicks on Facebook ads is a challenging machine learning task. In this paper we introduce a model which combines decision trees with logistic regression, outperforming either of these methods on its own by over 3%, an improvement with significant impact to the overall system performance. We then explore how a number of fundamental parameters impact the final prediction performance of our system. Not surprisingly, the most important thing is to have the right features: those capturing historical information about the user or ad dominate other types of features. Once we have the right features and the right model (decisions trees plus logistic regression), other factors play small roles (though even small improvements are important at scale). Picking the optimal handling for data freshness, learning rate schema and data sampling improve the model slightly, though much less than adding a high-value feature, or picking the right model to begin with.},
